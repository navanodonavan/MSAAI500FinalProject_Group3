**Project Intro/Objective**

The main purpose of this project is to assess different statistical models to see performance on the SPY index. Identify the pros and cons of each model and select a model to continue investigating. We want to identify which model would be the most practical in applying to real world financial practice. Instead of going the traditional route and trying to predict a stock, we decided to apply a logistic regression model to predict whether SPY will close green or red on a given day. To take a step further, we plan to apply our model of other stocks within the index to observe performance. The primary goal is to validate the logistic regression model against SPY because that is one of the primary indexes that determine market performance. 

Financial Portfolio Managers are always looking for any edge they can get in the markets. If we can provide an accurate model that can predict whether the market will close red or green, it'll provide a slight edge to the portfolio manager
